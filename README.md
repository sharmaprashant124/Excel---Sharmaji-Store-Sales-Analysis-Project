# Excel---Sharmaji-Store-Sales-Analysis-Project

In this project, I analysed and evaluated the data of a sales store in order to create a better understanding and visualization of the client's data. 
In order to do that I first cleaned the data analysed the data using pivot tables and created some pivot charts that were in turn used to make a very interactive dashboard for the client.
